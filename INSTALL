Transmogrify uses the cmake cross platform build system.
Follow the instructions on `http://www.cmake.org` to install cmake.

- Go to the build directory:

    cd build

- Use cmake to generate platform specific Makefile's.

    cmake ../

- Build the library.

    make

- Install the library.

    make install

To use the library use the include statement

    #include <tmf.h>

and add the following flag to your compiler/linker when building.

    -ltmf

Note that to use the functions from C++ you need to include the header
as follows.

extern "C"
{
#include <tmf.h>
}
