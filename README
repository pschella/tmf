Transmogrify is a fast, accurate and easy to use C/C++ library for
astronomical coordinate and time transformations.

Currently implemented are functions to:

* Convert between angles in degrees, radians and h, m, s notations.
* Convert between dates in the Julian or Gregorian calendar and Julian days.
* General purpose coordinate transformations, e.g. Cartesian, polar,
  spherical and cylindrical.
* Calculate nutation and obliquity of the ecliptic.
* Calculate sidereal time (GMST, GAST and LAST).
* Convert between equatorial and horizontal coordinates.
* Convert between equatorial and galactic coordinates.
* Convert directions between J2000 and B1950 epochs.

Transmogrify is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public
License. It was originally written by Pim Schellart.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
